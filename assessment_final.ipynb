By using OOP in this project, it is much easier to rapidly cycle through a grid of hyper paramaters and subsequently output and results gained. This also means that less indents are reuqired to accomplish the same task, resulting in cleaner code which is much easier to understand.\n",

For the current scenario, it is suited perfectly and offers an optimised solution.\n",

Given the type of model, and the large separation of the data (*e.g pregnancies: 1, glocouse: 168), the data must be pre-processed before it can be accuratly analysed by the **SVC**. Problems can easily arise in the effectiveness of Linear based algorithms, this is where the **StandardScaler** is useful inside the pipline. Instead of predefining the the patient data (**X_train**, **X_test**, ...) after having been scaled, causing disruptions to the other ML model (**ada_model**), the data is scaled on access of the model. This means new test data added will also not need to be scaled, as the pipline will automatically handle any scaling needs. \n",

First being scaled, reducing the variance in the source data, then being passed further down the pipline to the SVC model and specified kernel. At its root, the **Standard Scaler** function is designed to help convert values from different formats into a single scale. It is designed to ensure that each feature has a mean of 0 and a unit of standard deviation. This is useful for Kernels such as *RBF*, which assumes that all features are centered around a 0 origin."

    "# Systematic Grid Search\n",
    "\n",
    "**SKLearn** deos include a standard grid search function: *GridSearchCV*. It is described as an \"*exhaustive* search\" over a definied paramater list. First it trains each possibility of **hyperparamaters** and scores them, using the most admirable for the final predictions. This function is ***increably exhaustive*** when searching over a large dataset. Instead of preforming an optimised search, this algorithm aims to save all possibilities in memory. This would be insignifigant when only checking a few hundred tests. However, with the hundreds of millions of combinations: **how do you know which to test**? \n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to use the GridSearchCV function for these millions of test paramaters, however the computational requirements are *linear to the **number of tests** $*$ **memory usage for the model selected***. This can easily cause any computer to come to a grinding hault and freeze, even possibly resulting in a BSOD error. The *optimal memory usage should be **memory usage for the model selected** $*$ **number of best solutions***. For this search, as seen in the *Comparison Function*, the max number of best solitions to be stored in active memory should not exceed the number of best solutions, *10*, and an additional solution for the one being tested. This gives a *final memory usage of **11** $*$ **memory usage for the model selected***.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the memory optimisation of the custom search functions, it would be possible to preform searches on computers with limited memory availability. Dependent on the speed of the computer, and the size of the test, this could still take days to analyse for the most optimal hyperparamaters: however, in theory it should only need to run once as all best solutions found are stored in an external data-structure. **More will be spoken about that later**, but the key benefits of searching in this style is that it gives *functionalty to find the best paramaters inside of an **infinitly large pool of paramaters***. That is, ***so long as you have enough time to wait***. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a deal breaker for the health industry, whos computer power usually lags behind civilisation due to lack of funding."

    "## Grid Search Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these functions are structured in the same way for simplistic calling conventions, they also use the same logic: giving exceptions for differences needed by the individual model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whent he function is called, a few new *local varaibles* are defined. **iterationCount** is inconsequential to the flow of the actual search, however does it allows the program operator to see how many tests have been completed. This is used in combination with the **number_of_tests** constant, which is calculated by multiplying the length of all of the hyper paramater arrays together. These are later used to give a direct number of tests remaining, affirming to the operator: *tests are still being executed*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the **Best Solutions** output is prepared. A new file is created in the JSON file format and a singular bracket and newline is written. This allows the different, best solutions, to be indexed and referenced as independent dictionarys. The final stage of preperation occurs when pushing an empty solution and the worst possible score for the model to acheive. This kick-starts the solution comparison, without it there is nothing to compare against and nothing to iterate. Because this data is added to the respective lists directly, there they will not be outputted to the **Best Solutions**. Neither will they be output to the **Best 10 Solutions**, the first few tests will overwite them no *matter how good they actually are*: the initial push is relativly much worse.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the bullk of the functions. Both are rooted on the principle: multiple nested for loops, incrementally cycling through the test paramaters held by **data**. These values are passed to the relative model's dictionary which is then subsequently passed to the class instance reprenting the Machine Learning model chosen. The prediction function is then called, on termination the class is passed to the *Comparison Function*. \n",
    "\n",
    "On completion of each itteration, an addition macro is applied to the **iterationCount** variable so that the completion percentage of the search can be accuratly seen. Every time the algorithm completes one inner loop: the **Iterations** TXT is overwritten.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the entire search as been completed, a final closing bracket is added to the **Best Solutions**. Finally, the **Best 10 Solutions** are produced."
